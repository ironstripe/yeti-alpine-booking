# Roadmap

## Security P0.2
- [x] Step 1A: anon `get-booking-request` Edge Function + RequestConfirmation switched to it
- [x] Step 1B: lock down SECURITY DEFINER functions (grants + role checks)
- [ ] Verify office/admin paths with a real office login (blocked: no office account available)
- [ ] Decision: request-received email needs a server-side sender (was browser-side with customer email)
- [x] Follow-up: `useBookingRequest` moved to submit-booking-request (Step 1D)
- [ ] Step 2A: applied 21:42, ROLLED BACK 21:52 on user emergency request — anon access is open again; waiting for user reason/go before retry
- [ ] Step 3: role-scoped authenticated policies (not started)

## Private-lesson appointments (plan 2026-09-30)
- [x] Stage 1: private_appointments table + ticket_items.appointment_id (additive)
- [x] Stage 2: backfill dry run — 0 future private items, nothing to backfill
- [ ] Stage 3: booking creation writes appointments + mirroring (blocked: user decisions 1–4)
- [ ] Stage 4: Scheduler reads appointments (after Stage 3)
